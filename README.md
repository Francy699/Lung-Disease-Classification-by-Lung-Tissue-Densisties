# Lung-Disease-Classification-by-Lung-Tissue-Densisties
The Lung Disease Classification project uses 100,000+ chest X-ray images from Kaggle to train a DenseNet121 model for predicting diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and Streamlit, it offers real-time predictions via image uploads, optimized with transfer learning and deployed on Heroku.
